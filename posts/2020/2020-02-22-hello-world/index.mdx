I have seen the same situation many times now in my career as a VBA
Developer about how source code control is managed with VBA projects.

Source control on VBA has long been a bit `inline code` of a nonsense, there isn't
any really. When I started my first developer role it was talked about
in my team why we don't use it and the best efforts the team did at
the time was save the new version to a different folder location and

**to compare changes in the code from `inline code` a previous version meant getting a
text compare app copy pasting the code into it from the two different
versions so you could track what was changed.**
